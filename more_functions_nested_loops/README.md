**This project covers:**
* Nested loops and how to use them
* How do you use functions
* Difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* The gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
* Header files and how to to use them with #include

[3-print\_numbers.c](/0x03-more_functions_nested_loops/3-print_numbers.c) - Function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line

[4-print\_most\_numbers.c](/0x03-more_functions_nested_loops/4-print_most_numbers.c) - Function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line

[5-more\_numbers.c](/0x03-more_functions_nested_loops/5-more_numbers.c) - Function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line
